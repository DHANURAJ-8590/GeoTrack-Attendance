# GeoTrack-Attendance
This project is a Geofencing-based Attendance System designed to automate and streamline employee /student attendance management using real-time location tracking. The system leverages geofencing technology to detect when a user enters or exits a predefined geographic boundary, triggering an attendance check-in or check-out.
